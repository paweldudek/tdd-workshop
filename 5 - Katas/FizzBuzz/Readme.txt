Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" 
instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 
three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Steps:

Lets divide this into different steps so, we can easily write and test this.
- Print numbers from 1 to 100
- Print "Fizz" instead of number which is divisible by 3
- Print "Buzz" instead of number which is divisible by 5
- Print "FizzBuzz" instead of number which is divisible by both 3 and 5
